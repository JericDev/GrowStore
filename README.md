## Useful Information

- If you forked this repository up, and sees the stock folder, do not delete the folder.

- Mainly, this bot uses txt file as the product and the user who bought will be given the txt file.

- To create a stock file, you can only use txt as a file extension alongside the name are very case sensitive.

  - Example:
  - PID_9.txt
    - PID stand for Product ID and the user who bought will have to type PID for the product code.
    - "9" can be higher or lower, are basically the stock count. You need to hardcode the stock count and match the count from the `/product list`
  - So if you have 9 stocks you need to write the stock file as `PID_9`, `PID_8`, and so on.
  - Because in the database itself, its counting the stock. So if you set the stock to 10, the bot will look for the highest stock first.

- For the main currency, this bot uses "World Lock" from Growtopia game. There are no manually add World Lock to your account's balance, unless it's given from the database itself.

- The webhook are integrated with the "bot" from the _Growtopia_ itself, so the bot that are in the _Growtopia_ can detects the donation log and it will send you the embed to your Discord channel.

- To add balance, Set your GrowId first using `/user set <growid>`. This system detects a webhook containing an embed and then detects the _player name_, _item name_, and the _amount_. So the bot will detect for specific item name such as `Diamond Lock` or `World Lock`.
